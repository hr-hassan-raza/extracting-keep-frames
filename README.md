# extracting-keep-frames
Extracting key frames from video using adaptive thresholding. Python-OpenCV


1. Write a program to implement the key frame selection technique for video summarization,
find the video (basketball) on Blackboard. Obtain the adaptive threshold using the mean of
the statistical differences of each batch with its corresponding standard deviation. Investigate
and discuss the influence of changing the batch size using:
a) 29 frames
b) 145 frames
c) The whole video frames
You may set the constant value (B) is 0.5 or any other.
2. Retrieve the video at 30 fps using only the key frames that have been selected from part 1 (b)
(Use the original corresponding RGB frames).
